Using **normalized ratings** instead of actual ratings has both advantages and disadvantages.

#### **Advantages of Normalization:**
1. **Eliminates Bias from Individual Rating Scales:** Some users may consistently give high or low ratings. Normalization ensures that each userâ€™s ratings are scaled comparably, preventing bias from affecting recommendations.
2. **Enables Fair Comparisons:** Since different users may use different portions of the rating scale, normalization brings all ratings to a common scale, making it easier to compare preferences across users.

#### **Disadvantages of Normalization:**
1. **Loses Absolute Preference Information:** If a user only rates movies they love (e.g., giving only 4s and 5s), normalization forces these ratings to a full scale (0 to 1), misrepresenting their preferences.
2. **Can Introduce Artificial Differences:** Users with little variance in their ratings may see artificial exaggeration in their scaled ratings, making small differences appear more significant than they are.

While normalization is useful for certain analytical and predictive tasks, it should be applied carefully, considering the data context and the goals of the recommendation system.
